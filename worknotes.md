How to update your FeedLand to v0.7.0

* at the MySQL command line

```sql

alter table items add column metadata json not null default (json_object());

```

* in the directory you run FeedLand from 

```

npm update

```

* version numbers

* feedland: v0.7.0

* feedlanddatabase: v0.8.2

* wpidentity: v0.5.25

* notes

* The SQL command may take a long time to run, depending on the size of your <i>items</i> table.

* If you're installing a fresh FeedLand just follow the usual instructions, it automatically creates an items table with a metadata column. (This should be tested too.)

Why

<p>The reason this is a more difficult update is that we're adding a column to the `items` table, `metadata`, which is a JSON object. 

<p>It will allow us to add new data to the database without having to go through this again. The rule is, we only put data here that passes through the feedlanddatabase level, data it doesn't need to do its stuff.

<p>I'm doing this now because I want to keep two bits of information for every item -- `wpSiteId` and `wpPostId`. 

<p>These values are present for posts that emanate from a WordPress site. They are present in feeds from those sites. We also support this data in the feeds WordLand generates. 

<p>This data was necessary so the highest levels of the new version WordLand can know if a post coming in through FeedLand came from one of the user's sites. This means we can put an <i>Edit This Page</i> button when we display the item in a twitter-like timeline.

Changed the default of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/config.json#L35">config.database.flUseMySql2</a> to true. Gave it some thought, listened to <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/67#issuecomment-3169306552">Chuck's opinion</a>, decided it was worth stepping into the future. It's been running with this package on feedland.com for over a year. 

#### 8/7/25; 1:43:02 PM by DW

Fixed a mistake in yesterday's update about where flUseMySql2 is. It's part of the database object in config.json. 

I added it to the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/config.json#L35">starter config.json template</a>, with the value of false, which has been the default all along, thus is the safest choice.

Removed the note I added yesterday in the config.json docs, and included what it said here:

* If config.database.flUseMySql2 is true, FeedLand will use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2">mysql2</a> package. 

There was a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/67">discussion</a> of this in the Issues section, and it would be a good place to post a question or comment.

New config <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/config.md#legaltags">setting</a>, legalTags, configures what HTML you allow to pass from a feed into the database. The default is to let through &lt;p> and &lt;br>.

#### 5/27/24; 12:18:38 PM by DW

New config settings, `membershipClosedHeadline` and `membershipClosedExplanation` can customize the default messages in the signon dialog in FeedLand. 

They default to the previously hard-coded messages.

TL;DR -- <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql">setup.sql</a> has been updated so it now creates a database that's compatible with the current version of the server software. If you need to convert an existing installation to the new software, you'll have to do what I did in the steps below, or you could export subscription lists and start over with a fresh database. 

See this <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/feb2024transition.md">special docs page</a> for a step-by-step account of how to upgrade an existing installation.

Added an index <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/41#issuecomment-1791143618">recommended</a> by Scott Hanson. 

`create index itemGuidUrl on items(guid, feedUrl);`

It took about four minutes to run on feeland.org. 

Also added it to the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql#L163">SQL code</a> used to initialize a fresh FeedLand.

Added two index creation commands to the end of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql">setup.sql</a>. These had been added manually to feedland.org, but not documented here. They improve performance for rivers of lots of feeds like my <i>All</i> category.

Documented flRenewSubscriptions. It's been there since 10/29/22. There are times you want it off, esp when running behind a firewall, you're asking to renew but you won't pass the test. It accomplishes nothing in that case but wasting resources.

Previous versions saved pending confirmations in memory and on disk in stats.json. This worked fine where there is one instance of feedland.js, but now we're scaling up so there can be many instances, all working on the same data. This means we have to have the option to store pending confirmations in the database so all instances can work off the same data. 

If you're running a single-instance FeedLand , the defaults are set so that it continues to operate as before. If you want to update to use the database as storage for pending confirmations, this is what you have to do.

1. In config.json, add a new setting, flUseDatabaseForConfirmations set to true.

<code>flUseDatabaseForConfirmations: true,</code>

2. In your database, create a new table called pendingConfirmations.

```SQLcreate table pendingConfirmations (	magicString varchar (25),	email text,	flDeleted boolean, 	screenname text,	flNewUser boolean,	urlRedirect text,	whenCreated datetime,	primary key (magicString)	);```

3. cd into the directory containing feedland.js and npm install.

Of course you need to reboot FeedLand to reflect the new setup. 

I have also updated the docs to reflect this new feature.

Previously confirmations expired after one hour by default. I changed the default to 24 hours. There were complaints that they expired too quickly. It's hard for me to understand what causes the delay, but let's give them a bit more grace. You can of course change this setting.

<code>confirmationExpiresAfter: 60 * 60 * 24,</code>

To test, sign off and sign back on. Create a new account. Please report any problems <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/37">in this thread</a>.

New version, gets the updated prefs system in the database. 

No feature in FeedLand that's waiting for this feature, I added it for another project I'm working on, one which makes it possible to build apps on FeedLand as a platform. 

When you want to install the new version:

1. <i>npm update</i> the feedland.js app.

2. In MySQL, run this command: <i>alter table users add apps json;</i>

3. Relaunch feedland.js.

It's now possible to read the source.opml file for this repo by clicking a <a href="http://gitsourcereader.opml.org/?repo=feedlandInstall">link</a>.

It doesn't work for this site right now because it's still private and the gitSourceReader app needs to read the source.opml file over HTTP.
